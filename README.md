What were the most difficult tasks?

Did you learn anything new while completing this assignment?
- Not really, these are all tasks I have done on the job.

What did you not have time to add? What work took the up majority of your time?
- I didn't have time to add infinite scrolling and retrieving more results
- Majority of the time took to ensure the page was responsive and looked appropriate in all dimensions.

How could the application be improved?
- At the moment, the api only returns back 10 results per page and we are only fetch the first 5 pages.
- It would be helpful to implement an infinite scroll or some way to retrieve more results
- It would be great to hover over a movie on the grid to view more details
  - Like the actors, awards, directors, etc..
